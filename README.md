# Iris_Flower_Classification
Project Prerequisites
To successfully complete this project, we need the following Python libraries:
1.	NumPy: For numerical computations and handling arrays.
2.	Matplotlib: For data visualization through plots and graphs.
3.	Seaborn: For creating advanced visualizations with ease.
4.	Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
5.	Scikit-learn: For implementing machine learning algorithms.
Steps to Classify Iris Flowers
1.	Load the Dataset: Import the Iris dataset into a pandas DataFrame and explore its structure.
2.	Analyze and Visualize the Dataset: Gain insights through statistical analysis and create visualizations to understand feature relationships and class separations.
3.	Train the Model: Use a machine learning algorithm to train a predictive model on the dataset.
4.	Evaluate the Model: Assess the model's performance using metrics like accuracy and a classification report.
5.	Test the Model: Predict the class for new, unseen data points and validate the model's performance.
Summary
In this project, we built and trained a supervised machine learning model using Python in Google Colab. The process involved working on key aspects of machine learning, such as data analysis, data visualization, and model training and evaluation. This hands-on approach allowed us to implement core ML concepts while gaining insights into the Iris flower classification problem.
